About the Project

This project is a lightweight messenger application built using Python and Flask. As my third Python project, it focuses on web development, real-time communication, and handling user interactions.

Features:
- User Authentication: The messenger includes basic user registration and login functionality, ensuring secure access for each user.
- Real-Time Messaging: Users can send and receive messages instantly with real-time updates powered by Flask and WebSocket technology.
- Clean and Responsive UI: The interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly, ensuring a smooth experience across different devices.
- Message History: Chat history is stored, allowing users to scroll back and view past conversations.
- Scalability: The application is structured to be easily scalable for future enhancements and additional features.

This project allowed me to dive into web development concepts using Flask, focusing on routing, session management, and dynamic web content. It also provided valuable experience in integrating front-end and back-end technologies to create a fully functional web application.
